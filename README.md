The objective of this study is to analyze the values of houses in the suburbs of Boston using different socio-demographic characteristics of the population. The dataset (available in the scikit-learn datasets library) contains the description of 506 houses based on 13 predictive numerical/categorical variables. The median value (attribute 14) is usually the target.

These data represent a copy of the dataset available on UCI ML: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/

This dataset comes from the StatLib library which is held at Carnegie Mellon University: Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978. Used in Belsley, Kuh & Welsch, 'Regression diagnostics...', Wiley, 1980. Note: Various transformations are used in the table on pages 244-261 of the latter.

The data features (variables) are as follows (note: use these 12 variables) :

- CRIM per capita crime rate by town

- ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

- INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town

- CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

- NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

- RM average number of rooms per dwelling

- AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

- DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

- RAD index of accessibility to radial highways

- TAX full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

- PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town

- LSTAT % lower status of the population

- MEDV Median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars

Note: The variable B 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 should not be used. This variable is prohibited from the study.
